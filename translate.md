How to translate
----------------

Create a copy of `levels_en.js`, and change `en` with your language.

Open `index.html` and add your script on top.

Edit your script, change `'en'` with your languange in `strings['en']` and `levels['en']`

Translate every strings after semicolons, except HTML tags and `selector` values : this is needed for the game to work!
